title: The Cicada

---

Translated from a famous poem in Tang Dynasty.

## The Cicada

Yu Shinan, Tang Dynasty

Dangling its tassels, drinking the pure dew on tree as wine;  
Singing its songs, sound flowing through the sycamores so fine.  
Standing as high, so far its tune flies.  
Not asking the autumn wind to carry its noise to skies.   

## 蝉

唐·虞世南

垂緌饮清露，  
流响出疏桐。  
居高声自远，  
非是藉秋风。
